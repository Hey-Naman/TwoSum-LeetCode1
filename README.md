# TwoSum Java Program

This Java program takes user input to create an array and then finds two numbers in the array whose sum is equal to a given target.
- I used brute force in this solution but you can use hashmaps, two pointers or whatever you are comfortable with.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hey-Naman/TwoSumJava.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd TwoSum-LeetCode1
    ```

3. Compile the Java file:

    ```bash
    javac TwoSum.java
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java TwoSum
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the size of the array, its elements, and the target sum.

## Usage

1. Enter the size of the array when prompted.
2. Input each element of the array as requested.
3. Specify the target sum.
4. The program will then check if there are two elements in the array whose sum matches the Target.

## Example

```bash
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter your 0 element of array: 1
Enter your 1 element of array: 2
Enter your 2 element of array: 3
Enter your 3 element of array: 4
Enter your 4 element of array: 5
You want the sum of: 9
The number is found on the index 2 and 3
